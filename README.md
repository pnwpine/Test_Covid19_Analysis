# Test_Covid19_Analysis
I found a few public datasets that allowed me to peer into the spread and infection/death rates related to the COVID19 virus. This is a very basic approach and a basis for me to get some situational awareness into the field. 


# A few notes:
 *Ipyleaflet does not render with the github Jupyter Notebook. You will need to download the file and run it locally. (I reccomend using Anaconda)
 
 If you have any questions/comments/reccomendations, please send me a message! :)
